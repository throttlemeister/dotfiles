prep_opensuse_desktop.sh can be copied or downloaded by itself and used to setup the entire system for the chosen user. It will download and install git, ansible, the dotfiles repo, ansible repo, and kick off an ansible playbook to install a set of standard utilities and software and set the user up for sudo.
