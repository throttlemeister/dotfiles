This repository contains a bunch of configuration files I use to set up my personal system. These include:

- alacritty; my configuration for the Alacritty terminal emulator
- bash; some basic bash profile information for BASH
- conky; my conky configuratios for both laptop and desktop
- fish; a collection of fish functions and plugins that I have either downloaded (plugins) or created myself
- scripts; a collection of scripts I wrote and use
- X; some setup changes for X11
- zsh; some basic profile information for ZSH

These are all personal and useful for me, but you are free to look and or use for inspiration as you will likely need to edit before applying to your own system or way of working.
