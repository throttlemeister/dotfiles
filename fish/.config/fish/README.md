# fish
My setup of the Friendly Interactive SHell (fish)

### Prompt
The prompt (fish_prompt), based on Oh-My-Fish Bira theme and the standard Kali Linux bash prompt.\
\
Bira theme from oh-my-fish (https://github.com/oh-my-fish/theme-bira) was based on Bira theme from oh-my-zsh (https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme) and the oh-my-fish Clearance theme (https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish/blob/master/themes/clearance/)
